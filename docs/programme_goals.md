# Team Objectives...
The RRA Team are currently working on a collaborative C++ project on home PCs with the goal of writing a simple engine for simulating Radar Targets. This is an innovation project with opportunities to experience software development from a non-restricted application based development perspective.

Interpersonal/Team Objectives: 
- Trial free software for remote communication and collaboration 
- Building inter-team awareness and broadening college support networks
- Share knowledge/interests in areas related to the Software and Radar domain 
- Develop using easy to use open-source cloud based tools
- *Keep work fun* and everyone motivated 

Technical/Company Objectives: 
- Developing and diversifying our c++ expertise
- Practice reuse of commercial grade public C++ libraries 
- Trial some architecture we were hoping to use in our commercial code
